                  WaitFor defines a duration to delay sending a health-based notification.
                  After this period, the health status is reassessed to confirm it hasn't
                  changed, helping prevent false alarms from transient issues.


                  The delay allows time for self-recovery or temporary fluctuations to
                  resolve, reducing unnecessary alerts.


                  If specified, it should be a valid duration string (e.g., "5m", "1h").
