              waitFor:
                description: |-
                  WaitFor defines a duration to delay sending a health-based notification.
                  After this period, the health status is reassessed to confirm it hasn't
                  changed, helping prevent false alarms from transient issues.

                  The delay allows time for self-recovery or temporary fluctuations to
                  resolve, reducing unnecessary alerts.

                  If specified, it should be a valid duration string (e.g., "5m", "1h").
                type: string
              waitForEvalPeriod:
                description: |-
                  WaitForEvalPeriod defines an additional delay following the waitFor period.
                  After waitFor completes, the system actively re-scrapes the resource
                  and then waits this duration before final evaluation, unlike waitFor which
                  simply delays without re-scraping.

                  Only applies to Kubernetes health notifications and cannot be turned off.
                  Defaults to 30s.
