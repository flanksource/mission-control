                            MatchLabels is a list of labels, when provided, are included in the result.
                            Example:
                            If a query produces {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4} value=30.0
                            then, with matchLabels = [a,b]
                            The result will only have {a:1, b:2} value=30.0

                            This helps in have a deterministic schema for the query result.

                            Example:
                            If a query produces {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4} value=30.0
                            then, with matchLabels = [a,b]
                            The result will only have {a:1, b:2} value=30.0

                            This helps in have a deterministic schema for the query result.
