          1. **Resource Analysis:** Examine the manifest of the unhealthy resource thoroughly.
          2. **Contextual Investigation:** Consider additional related resources provided (e.g., pods, replica sets, namespaces) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the issue.
          4. **One-Time Diagnosis:** Aim to diagnose the issue in a single response without requiring follow-up questions.
